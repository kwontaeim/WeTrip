- AJAX
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is the art of exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page without reloading the whole webpage. In other words, AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. If application are not using AJAX, then it will have to reload the webpage on every request user made.<br><br>

-JSON
In recent years, essence of XML has been reduced. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is often used as an alternative format for data interchange, although other formats such as preformatted HTML or plain text can also be used for data purpose.

- node.js<br>
We Trip use Node.js for checking duplicate email address.
Node.js has extraordinary features when it comes to developing real-time applications such as chats and gaming apps. It is also a good fit for the programs that need event-based server, as well as non-blocking driven servers.
